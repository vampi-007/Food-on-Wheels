# Food on Wheels - Object-Oriented Programming Project

Food on Wheels is an object-oriented programming project designed to develop a mobile app for food trucks. The primary goal of the project is to provide users with a seamless experience of ordering food from their favorite food trucks. The app offers a range of features, such as searching for nearby food trucks, viewing menus, placing orders for delivery or pickup, and tracking the delivery status.

The project uses the object-oriented programming (OOP) approach to develop the app's various components, such as the user interface, menu items, and order tracking system. The OOP approach allows for modular code development, making it easy to add or modify features without affecting the existing codebase.

One of the main features of the Food on Wheels app is the ability to search for food trucks based on the user's location. The app uses the GPS functionality of the user's mobile device to identify nearby food trucks and displays their locations on a map. Users can also view the food trucks' menus and place orders through the app. The app supports various payment options, such as credit cards, online wallets, or cash on delivery.

Another key feature of the app is the order tracking system, which allows users to track their orders' delivery status in real-time. The system notifies the user of the estimated delivery time, the order's preparation status, and the delivery driver's location.

In conclusion, the Food on Wheels project is an exciting endeavor that leverages the power of object-oriented programming to develop a mobile app for food trucks. The app's intuitive user interface, real-time order tracking system, and support for various payment options make it an excellent choice for foodies who love to order food on the go.
